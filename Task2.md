# Task 2

I've already implemented this functionality.
The library I used for this project is called react-chartjs-2 which relies on Chart.js, one of the most used light weight libraries for charts in react applications, and it provides a method called .toBase64Image() that gives you the image data. Then I added a regular link with the download property, making this extremely easy to setup.
