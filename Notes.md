# Considerations

- I made a proxy to bypass a CORS issue and to provide more security for the API_KEY. This proxy is super basic, it doesn't have any folder structure at all because I thought I was goingo way over the scope.
- Task 2 functionality is already implemented.
- I used your image as an idea but I proposed a new design.
- I added some things to give a full look of the page and not have a lot of space without things. For example, I added different links such as settings, log out, etc but they don't have a corresponding page, they're there to add content. The same for the Trends tab.
- I didn't know how to adapt the chart for mobile I mean, there's not enough space for that.
- On the datepickers I wasn't sure if I should allow past dates but I thought maybe some people like to see historic data so that's why you can select past dates.
- There were some ports options where your API returned an error.
