# Considerations

- I made a proxy to bypass a CORS issue and to provide more security for the API_KEY. This proxy is super basic, it doesn't have any folder structure at all because I thought I was goingo way over the scope.
- Task 2 functionality is already implemented.
- I used your image as an idea but I proposed a new design.
- The filter functionality is already provided by the library. For example, if you want to see only the data for average, you'd have to click on the high and low labels to hide them and the chart refreshes.
- If you hover over the dots, you can see the date, the value and the type of the element. For example, '2020-10-02, high: 2100'.
- I added some things to give a full look of the page and not have a lot of space without things. For example, I added different links such as settings, log out, etc but they don't have a corresponding page, they're there to add content. The same for the Trends tab and the icons such as the forward and bookmark.
- I didn't know how to adapt the chart for mobile I mean, there's not enough space for that.
- On the datepickers I wasn't sure if I should allow past dates but I thought maybe some people like to see historic data so that's why you can select past dates.
- There were some ports options where your API returned an error.
